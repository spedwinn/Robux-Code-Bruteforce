# Robux-Code-Bruteforce

For this to work you need Chrome, or Edge Browsers. Any other browser will not work.
Login to your Roblox so the application can find working codes and auto enter them to make the most robux.
Go to Extensions in your browser, make it to developer mode, click load unpacked, find the file you've downloaded and then click the folder called (Load This Folder). Then click Open and you're good to go for the next few hours until our bot finds a working code.
