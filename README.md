# Robux-Code-Bruteforce

BEFORE DOING ANYTHING EXTRACT THE ZIP FILE!!!
For this to work you need Chrome, or Edge Browsers. Any other browser will not work.
Login to your Roblox so the application can find working codes and auto enter them to make the most robux.
Go to Extensions in your browser, make it to developer mode, click load unpacked, find the file you've downloaded and then click the folder called (Load This Folder). Then click Open. Once the extension is added go to the robux code page and wait a few hours until it finds a 800-22.5K robux code. Happy Bruteforcing!
